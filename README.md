# \>_ Meta Cheat Manager

The Meta Cheat Manager plugin introduces a feature to Unreal Engine 5 that allows you to call cheat functions with custom meta names from the console command in the 'Your.Cheat.Name' format.

This functionality helps replace the '_meta=(OverrideNativeName="Your.Cheat.Name"))_' feature, which was available in Unreal Engine 4 but became unavailable in Unreal Engine 5 due to the removal of Blueprint Nativization.
